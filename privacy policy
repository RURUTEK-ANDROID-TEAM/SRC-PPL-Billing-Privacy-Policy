1. What Information Do We Collect?

Personal Information You Disclose to Us

We collect personal information you voluntarily provide when you express interest in our services, participate in activities on our platform, or contact us. All personal information must be true, complete, and accurate, and you should notify us of any changes.

Sensitive Information

We do not process sensitive personal information, such as racial or ethnic origins, sexual orientation, or religious beliefs.

Application Data

When using our SRC PPL Billing app, we may collect:





Mobile Device Access: We may request access to your device’s camera, storage, or other features. You can manage these permissions in your device settings.



Push Notifications: We may send notifications about your account or app features. You can opt out via your device settings.

This information is used to maintain security, troubleshoot issues, and support internal analytics and reporting.

Third-Party Information

We do not collect information from third parties.



2. How Do We Process Your Information?

We process your personal information to:





Provide, improve, and administer our services.



Communicate with you.



Ensure security and prevent fraud.



Comply with legal obligations.

We may also process your information for other purposes with your consent. We only process your data when we have a valid legal basis to do so.



3. When and With Whom Do We Share Your Personal Information?

We may share your personal information in the following situations:





Business Transfers: During mergers, sales, financing, or acquisitions, we may share or transfer your information to another company.

We do not share your information with third parties for other purposes unless explicitly stated.



4. Do We Use Cookies and Other Tracking Technologies?

We may use cookies, web beacons, or similar technologies to collect information when you interact with our services. These technologies help maintain security, prevent crashes, fix bugs, save preferences, and support basic site functions.

Third parties and service providers may also use tracking technologies for analytics and advertising, such as tailored ads or abandoned cart reminders, based on your preferences. For more details, refer to our Cookie Notice.

You can manage cookie settings in your browser, but disabling cookies may affect certain features of our services.



5. How Long Do We Keep Your Information?

We retain your personal information only as long as necessary for the purposes outlined in this policy, unless a longer period is required or permitted by law (e.g., for tax or accounting purposes).

When we no longer have a legitimate business need to process your information, we will delete or anonymize it. If deletion is not possible (e.g., data in backup archives), we will securely store and isolate it until deletion is feasible.



6. How Do We Keep Your Information Safe?

We implement appropriate technical and organizational security measures to protect your personal information. However, no online transmission or storage system is 100% secure, and we cannot guarantee protection against hackers, cybercriminals, or unauthorized third parties.

You access our services at your own risk and should use a secure environment.



7. Do We Collect Information from Minors?

We do not knowingly collect data from or market to individuals under 18 years of age, nor do we sell their personal information. By using our services, you confirm you are at least 18 or are a parent/guardian consenting to a minor’s use.

If we learn that we have collected data from users under 18, we will deactivate their accounts and promptly delete their information. Contact us at srcprojectsprivatelimited1964@gmail.com if you suspect we have collected data from a minor.



8. What Are Your Privacy Rights?

Depending on your location, you may have rights under applicable privacy laws, such as:





Accessing, correcting, or deleting your personal information.



Withdrawing consent to process your information (where consent is the legal basis).

To withdraw consent or exercise your rights, contact us at srcprojectsprivatelimited1964@gmail.com or submit a data subject access request. Withdrawing consent does not affect processing done lawfully before withdrawal or processing based on other legal grounds.

You can manage cookies and tracking technologies via your browser settings, though this may impact service functionality.



9. Controls for Do-Not-Track Features

Most browsers and mobile devices offer a Do-Not-Track (DNT) feature to signal your preference against online tracking. Currently, no uniform standard for DNT exists, and we do not respond to DNT signals. If a standard is adopted, we will update this policy to reflect our practices.



10. Do We Make Updates to This Notice?

We may update this Privacy Policy to comply with legal requirements or reflect changes in our practices. Updates will be marked with a revised date at the top. Significant changes will be communicated through prominent notices or direct notifications.

We encourage you to review this policy regularly to stay informed.
